# Computer Vision Drone

## Goal

This is a fun project to build an interactive drone. 

* that has computer vision features
* that has distance sensors
* that has audio in and output


First flight:

The drone should be able to ...

* navigate inside a room and detect obstacles 
* find persons and detect faces
* interact with persons
  * talk to the person
  * take a picture of the person
  * interact with social media (e.g.)
